# Mission_to_Mars
## The goal of this project is to create an app that scrapes the internet for specific mars facts and pictures, then displays them display them on a webpage that is interactive, and utilizes personalized HTML coding. 


### Particular challenges I ran into:

- Understanding the exact relationships between the app, scraping file, and HTML doc. 
- looping thru the button presses needed to pull the 4 different hemishperes and add them to a dictionary.
